# schema - 
# name, (optional: calories, protiens, cabs, weight), available_stock

# future work -
# can declare name as enum (as a restaurant can have a set of food items available)
# only display those foods having available_stock >= 1. Ajax polling to dynamic update the availability of foods based on available_stock
